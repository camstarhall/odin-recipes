Project Odin repo

This repo is for the first project for The Odin Project.

Whilst my HTML, CSS and JS skills are fairly good, I need to learn better practices and also spend some time using git and the CLI in general. This is also the foundation for a portfolio of sorts, which will be fully archived on my GitHub.

All of the images on this site are produced by MidJourney. All code and other information is my own unless otherwise stated.
