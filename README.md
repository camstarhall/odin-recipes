Project Odin repo

This repo is for the first project for The Odin Project.

Whilst my HTML, CSS and JS skills are fairly good, I need to learn better practices and also spend some time using git and the CLI in general. This is also the foundation for a portfolio of sorts, which will be fully archived on my GitHub.
