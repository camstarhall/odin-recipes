    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>4 salmon fillets (6 ounces each)</li>
      <li>Juice of 2 lemons</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        In a shallow dish, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, minced
        garlic, dried thyme, dried rosemary, salt, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the salmon fillets to the marinade, turning them to coat evenly. Let
        them marinate for 20-30 minutes at room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Lightly oil the grates to prevent
        sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the salmon from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off.
        Place the fillets on the grill, skin-side down.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill the salmon for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until it easily
        flakes with a fork and has reached your desired level of doneness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the grilled salmon to a serving platter and let it rest for a
        few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh herbs and lemon wedges if
        desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
