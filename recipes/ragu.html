    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>1.5 pounds (680g) beef chuck roast, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 carrots, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 celery stalks, finely chopped</li>
      <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 can (14 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
      <li>1/2 cup red wine (optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs (such as oregano, basil, thyme)</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pound (450g) pasta (such as fettuccine or pappardelle)</li>
      <li>Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over
        medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the beef cubes with salt and pepper, then add them to the pot.
        Cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the beef from
        the pot and set it aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pot, add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Saut√© for 5
        minutes until the vegetables start to soften.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the minced garlic and tomato paste to the pot and cook for another
        minute, stirring constantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the red wine (if using) and cook for a few minutes, scraping the
        bottom of the pot to release any browned bits.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the beef to the pot and add the crushed tomatoes, beef broth,
        dried Italian herbs, and bay leaf. Stir well to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot
        and let the ragu simmer for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally. For
        even more flavor, you can simmer it for up to 4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the ragu is simmering, cook the pasta according to the package
        instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta and set it aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the ragu has finished simmering, taste and adjust the seasoning
        with salt and pepper if needed. Remove the bay leaf.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the ragu over the cooked pasta, garnished with grated Parmesan
        cheese and chopped parsley if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
